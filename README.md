Arduino code for some multi LED stuff

Just playing around with a lot of different routines and patterns.  Basically a scratch pad for different LED animations and sensor integrations.

Now this is becoming more of a place to run some NeoPixel LEDs on my desk.
Ultimately it is about controlling said LEDs via serial for different animations and colors.

See the partner [repo](https://github.com/bentonmize/arduino_utility) for driving the lights from your computer.

Uses currently:
- GitHub build status
- "On air" LED (so people know if you're on a call)
- Amplify build status

## Tooling
I use the VS Code community Arduino extension!
